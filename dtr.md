Project: Little Shop Redux

Group Member Names: Rajaa, Patrick, Pat

Project Expectations:
What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Rajaa - Reinforce week 1 teaching, i.e. get a solid foundation for the rest of the mod.
Pat - I want to get a better feel for working in larger groups and more exposure to ruby embedded in HTML.
Patrick - Better understanding of active record.

Goals and expectations:
To build our first working and functional website. And complete through iteration 11.  Learn the differences between a paired project and a group projects git work flow.

Team strengths:
Patrick knows many things to help (css, html, sql), Rajaa and Pat while not knowing as much as Patrick will work hard to absorb as much information as we can.

How to overcome obstacles:
In order to overcome obstacles we will first try to find a solution within in the team, either in slack or in person.  If that fails we will get into contact with our cohort mates either in classroom or on slack, if that fails we will reach out to other people in the back end program.  

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): We plan on being available to work in person during the end of week 1 and transitioning to remote work more over the weekend and coming together during the beginning of week 2 to explain our individual components.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): we will have slack as on open line of communication between us when we are working remote, if in person we will be available to each other.  We will use the Pull Request template in order to keep team members aware of changes and all other git hub built in communication features.  We are also going to use Waffle.  Brief retros when done coding, either in person or on slack.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Patrick- get more comfortable with active record
Rajaa - wants to improve on all new concepts from the mod.
Pat- wants to get more comfortable with the new testing framework.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We all want to split the work evenly so each team member gets exposure to all aspects of the project.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): No one will merge their own pull requests, we will wait for others to review and then merge into master.  We are going to use waffle to keep our project on track.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We expect all feedback to be KIND SPECIFIC AND IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE.
